Question:
Based on the data provided, calculate the total combined outstanding balance from all contract types (instalment and non-instalment), including both active and guaranteed contracts. How many of these contracts show any overdue amount?

Answer:
Based on the provided credit report content, here are the calculations for the total combined outstanding balance and the number of contracts showing any overdue amount:

### Outstanding Balances:
1. **Instalments:**
   - Total Outstanding Balance: **90,000** (from the instalment section)

2. **Non-Instalments:**
   - Total Outstanding Balance for Credit Cards: **2,819** (from the non-instalment section)
   - Total Outstanding Balance for Overdraft: **2,300** (from the overdraft section)

### Total Combined Outstanding Balance:
- Instalments: **90,000**
- Non-Instalments (Credit Cards + Overdraft): **2,819 + 2,300 = 5,119**

**Total Combined Outstanding Balance = 90,000 + 5,119 = 95,119**

### Overdue Amounts:
- **Instalments:** Total Overdue Amount: **0** (indicating no overdue)
- **Non-Instalments:** Total Overdue Amount: **0** (indicating no overdue)

### Summary:
- **Total Combined Outstanding Balance:** **95,119**
- **Number of Contracts with Overdue Amount:** **0** (none of the contracts show any overdue amount)

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Total Combined Outstanding Balance:** 95,119
- **Contracts with Overdue Amount:** 0
